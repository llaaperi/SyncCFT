*** SyncCFT ***

SyncCFT is used to synchronize the contents of a selected folder between other connected application users. The synchronization is limited to this single folder and the subfolders are not synchronized. The application can sync with multiple different parties.


** Usage **

synccft [-c <client port>] [-s <server port>] [-p <p>] [-q <q>] [-k] [-d <dir>] [-v <version>] <hosts>
	-c: Client port
	-s: Server port
	-p: Markov P loss probability
	-q: Markov Q loss probability
	-k: Generate new secret key
	-d: Sync directory
	-v: Protocol version
	

-Example:
./synccft -d /Users/JohnDoe/Desktop/Sync --version 2 86.50.134.32
- Where 86.50.134.32 is another SyncCFT node and the synced directory is /Users/JohnDoe/Desktop/Sync
